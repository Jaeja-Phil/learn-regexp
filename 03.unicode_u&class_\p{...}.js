/**
 * Did you know JavaScript uses unicode encoding for strings?
 * This means that most characters are represented with 2 bytes, and can have upto 2**16 different characters
 *
 * ... but this is not big enough for ALL characters. There are emoji characters, special characters,
 * and even some characters that you may have never seen before.
 *
 * So, unicode supports upto 4 bytes and here are some example
 */

let emoji = "ðŸ˜„";
console.log(emoji.length); // returns 2

/**
 * As you can see, length treats 2 byte as 1, so 4 byte characters are treated as length === 2
 */

/**
 * Searching unicode properties
 * - use \p{...}
 * - use L to match "letter" property
 * - use N to match "number" property
 */

let weirdLetter = "ã„±";
console.log(weirdLetter.match(/\p{L}/gu)); // ["ã„±"], a korean alphabe is matched!
