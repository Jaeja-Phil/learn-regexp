### Classes are Everything You Put Inside Brackets

Putting characters in brackets lets the parser know what you are trying to match.

- ex) /[aaa]/ --> matches the first `a` in the given string: "aabb**a**aabbb"

> Why the First _`a`, not_ _`aaa`_ _as a whole?_

\- this is the default behavior of the parser

\- if you want to match `aaa`, you need to use a flag
